# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

The Colorado Board of Elections employee gave us tasks that need to be done for the election audit.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

We used pseudocode to create models to a roadmap of steps to complete the task at hand.
